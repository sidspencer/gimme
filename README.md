# gimme gimme gimme

A WebExtension for downloading media from webpages, especially for downloading image galleries with thumbnails that point to detail pages with large versions of the image on them. 

The code is there to download video and audio files as well, but is not currently exposed and has not been tested much. Feel free to un-hide the extra buttons in style.css to download the other media types.

Two terms are used for the automatic media-finding: Dig and Scrape. Dig is for galleries, and galleries of galleries -- sites where one must dig into the detail pages to find the original media. Scrape is for just getting whatever is on the page. 

It is currently available for firefox at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gimmegimmegimme/
